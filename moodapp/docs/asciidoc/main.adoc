== Features description 

=== User's mood addition and visualization
An user can add his mood, going from "awful" to "awesome" (whenever and as much as he wants for now).

A chart is created with the user's moods, showing the evolution of the mood.

There are also smileys counters and a pie chart that show the number and repartition of the previous entered moods.

=== Mood suggestion depending on the wheather
The OpenMeteo API recovers the weather on the user, depending on his location (for now, the default location is Paris).

The user's mood is then suggested, according to the current weather (for example, a rainy weather will suggest a sad mood).

The user can follow or not the mood suggestion when he adds his mood.

The current weather is saved when adding a mood. This will be helpful for improving or creating future features.
